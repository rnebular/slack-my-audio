# slack-my-audio
Goal to have Slack status emoji updated dynamically using the API, based on what I'm listening to.

Going to have to interact with the sound driver and Slack I don't want to handle credentials, just the audio status update. Will try to use the installed client if possible, but most likely the API will need to be used.

Need a slack app, this might work:

Notes until OneNote gets in the loop:
